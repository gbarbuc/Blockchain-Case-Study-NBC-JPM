# National Bank of Canada and J.P.Morgan test blockchain technology with NBC debt issuance in the US Financial Markets

In April 2018 NBC with the support of JPM, issued a USD 150M, one-year floating rate Yankee certificate of deposit, with a parallel simulation of the issuance using blockchain technology. 
In order to raise capital from American investors, NBC, which must have branches in US and must partner with at least one American Bank (in this case JP Morgan, Pfizer, and Western Asset), chose to issue CDs (Certificate of deposit) totaling 150M USD.
The idea in front of this transaction was to test blockchain technology that runs on JPMs Quorum, an open-source variant of the Ethereum blockchain. All the transactions were simulated in parallel using blockchain.....interesting. 
The CDs were then used as fixed term, fixed or floating rate, savings accounts "sold" to the American invesotrs.
Quorum was developed by JP Morgan and unveiled in 2016. The bank was trying to spin it off as a standalone entity. JP Morgan used its resources and capabilities of pushing the CDs while fully simulating all the transactions on Quorum blockchain. 
The test included functions like complete debt instrument lifecycle, including origination,distribution, execution, settlement, interest rate payments and maturity payments. 
Just recently, in August 2020 Quorum was aquired in order to be managed by ConsenSys as part of strategic investment by JPM.
The obvious interests in blockchain technologies by JPM which now has tools like JPM Coin, Interbank Information Network (IIN) and Quorum, drives the industry standards
delivering value to clients.
I would advise JPM to create a partnership with a major chip developer like NVIDIA or Intel in order to develop a chip with financial specific AI embeded in its architecture. 
Such a chip will give them an advantage over competitors. Think of it like a financial GPU, its architecture being geared towards financial modelling math.
